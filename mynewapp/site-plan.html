			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of my website is to simplify the process of finding applications that help with specific aspects of students' life.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The students of BYU Idaho</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>My plan to involve Javascript to the site is to filter into categories the applications. This would include using a list with at least two categories, when users choose one category, with Javascript, the site will answer by showing the respective content and hiding the one for the other category.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a
				href="https://coolors.co/920101-f0eaea-6d6666-4b4545-000000"
				target="_blank"

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>
						<th>Secondary</th>
						<th>Accent 1</th>
						<th>Accent 2</th>

						<td class="secondary">4B4545</td>
						<td class="accent1">6D6666</td>
						<td class="accent2">F0EAEA</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h4>
				Heading Font: Ravi Prakash

			<h4>
				Paragraph Font: Roboto Condensed

			<h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 10------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
			<nav>
				<a href="index.html">Home</a>
				<a href="moreapps.html">Other Apps</a>
			</nav>
			<hr />

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>In this page, I will have an image of an app that is really helpful for productivity and a small summary of it.</p>
			<img src="./styles/cleargreymain.png" alt="clearmain" />
			<h3>More Apps</h3>
			<p>In this subpage I will have a select button with two categories showing at least two apps from each that are related to the category.</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				I am still making changes to the navigation bar and looking to what would look better in terms of images but this page won't have a lot of interaction, instead it'll be showing an introduction to the content of the website.
			</p>
			<img src="./styles/homewireframe.png" alt="home page wireframe" />

			<h3>More Apps</h3>
			<p>
				This one might change depending on how many apps I end up showing, in the wireframe I showed them to the side, however, I am considering a slideshow or just a table with the images of apps.
